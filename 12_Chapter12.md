# Chapter 12: Interrupts and Exception Handling

Welcome back, coders! In the previous chapter, we had Linus Torvalds, founder of the Linux Operating System, as a special guest. We talked about pointers and structures, which are essential elements in programming. Today, Linus Torvalds will be joining us once again as we dive into the topic of interrupt and exception handling in ARM Assembly language. 

Interrupt and exception handling are essential topics for designing reliable and robust systems. Handling exceptions and interrupts properly can avoid system crashes, data loss, and other system requirements. In this chapter, we'll go over what interrupts and exceptions are, how they occur, and how to handle them in our code. 

We'll also cover two significant kinds of interrupts: external and internal interrupts. The external interrupts are a result of some external source, such as user input or an external device. On the other hand, internal interrupts originate from the processor, for instance, a divide-by-zero exception, and so on.

We'll also discuss how the Priority level of interrupts and exceptions is critical. Priority levels determine which will execute first if multiple interrupts or exceptions are triggered simultaneously. 

With Linus Torvalds's help, we'll demonstrate how to implement interrupt and exception handlers in ARM Assembly code. We'll use the ARM Cortex-M processor in examples, but the concepts apply to other ARM architectures.

So buckle up, coders! We're excited to dive deep into interrupt and exception handling with Linus Torvalds and show you how to write code that can handle even the most unexpected events.
# Chapter 12: Interrupts and Exception Handling

Welcome back, dear readers, to the story of Robin Hood and his band of merry programmers! In our last chapter, we saw Robin and his friends using their knowledge of pointers and structures to access and manipulate data. Today, they have a new challenge to face: interrupts and exception handling.

One day, while Robin and his band were camping in the forest, they came across a group of travelers who were in trouble. Their carriage had been attacked, and they needed urgent medical attention. Robin, being the kind-hearted soul he was, immediately offered to help. However, as they were attending to the wounded, they noticed something strange happening.

The processor of their medical device was freezing, and the device stopped working. Robin and his team knew something was amiss and quickly connected the processor to their laptops to see what was wrong. To their surprise, they discovered that the device was generating multiple interrupts, which the code was not handling correctly. They knew they had to act quickly to fix the issue, or the patient's life could be in grave danger.

At this moment, Robin remembered the wise words of Linus Torvalds, who had visited him earlier in his dreams. Linus had told him that exception and interrupt handling is essential knowledge for every programmer. Robin immediately got to work, with the help of his team, to modify the code so it could handle the unexpected events generated by the device.

Using a combination of pseudocode and ARM Assembly language, Robin and his team began writing interrupt and exception handlers that would identify the events and handle them appropriately. It wasn't easy, but they had the teachings of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders in their programming manual to guide them.

After several grueling hours of debugging and testing, Robin and his team finally managed to fix the issue. They ran some tests on the medical device and confirmed it was working correctly. The travelers were incredibly grateful and thanked Robin and his team for their quick thinking and expertise.

From that day forward, Robin and his team continued to use interrupt and exception handling with confidence. Linus Torvalds visited him often in his dreams, and together, they were able to write code that could handle even the most unexpected events.

So, dear readers, remember to pay attention to your code's interrupt and exception handling, and always stay vigilant, just like Robin Hood and his band of merry programmers!
In the Robin Hood story of Interrupts and Exception Handling, our hero had to modify the code to handle unexpected events generated by a medical device. They used the teachings of the ARM Assembly programming manual written by Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders to do this, along with the help of special guest Linus Torvalds.

In ARM Assembly language, interrupt handling involves the implementation of interrupt service routines (ISRs) for different sources of interrupts. An ISR is a section of code that is executed when an interrupt occurs. The ISR identifies the interrupt source and takes appropriate actions to handle it.

To implement the ISR, we first define a function that represents the ISR. In the function, we save the context of the interrupted code on the stack, including the current program counter (PC), Link register (LR), and other registers. We then process the interrupt event and update the system state if necessary. Finally, we restore the original context and return from the ISR.

Here is an example of an ISR implementation in ARM Assembly for an external interrupt:

```
ISR:
   ; Save context on the stack
   STMFD sp!, {r0-r12, lr}
   ; Process interrupt event
   ...
   ; Update system state if necessary
   ...
   ; Restore context from the stack
   LDMFD sp!, {r0-r12, pc}^
```

Exception handling in ARM Assembly involves the implementation of exception handlers for different types of exceptions. Like an ISR, an exception handler is a section of code that is executed when an exception occurs. The exception handler identifies the type of exception and takes appropriate actions to handle it.

To implement an exception handler, we first define a function that represents the exception handler. In the function, we save the context of the code that was executing before the exception occurred on the stack. We then process the exception event and update the system state if necessary. Finally, we restore the original context and return from the exception handler.

Here is an example of an exception handler implementation in ARM Assembly for a divide-by-zero exception:

```
DIVIDE_BY_ZERO:
   ; Save context on the stack
   STMFD sp!, {r0-r12, lr}
   ; Process exception event
   ...
   ; Update system state if necessary
   ...
   ; Restore context from the stack
   LDMFD sp!, {r0-r12, pc}^
```

In summary, to handle interrupts and exceptions in ARM Assembly, we define interrupt service routines and exception handlers that identify the source of the interrupt or type of exception, take appropriate actions to handle it, and restore the original context before returning from the interrupt or exception handler. By handling interrupts and exceptions correctly, we can avoid system crashes, data loss, and other severe system requirements.
