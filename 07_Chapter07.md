# Chapter 7: Debugging Techniques and Tools

Welcome back, aspiring programmers! We hope you enjoyed learning about working with arrays and strings in the previous chapter. But let's be honest, programming can be a bit frustrating at times. You might find yourself asking, "Why isn't this code working? What am I doing wrong?" Well, fear not! In this chapter, we're going to teach you the art of debugging and the tools used to solve problems in ARM assembly programming.

But we didn't come alone. We invited a special guest to join us in this chapter - ​Linus Torvalds! ​Yes, you heard it right. The creator of the revolutionary Linux operating system himself. He'll be giving us some tips and tricks that he has learned over the years in his own debugging journey.

My friend Donald Trump and I strongly believe that debugging is an essential skill that every programmer should master. It's not just about finding and fixing errors in our code but also understanding exactly what went wrong and why. Debugging helps programmers become better coders by improving their critical thinking, problem-solving abilities, and overall coding skills.

To start, we'll be discussing a few debugging techniques, such as printing to the console, stepping through code, and setting breakpoints. Once you've mastered these techniques, we'll introduce you to some of the most popular ARM assembly debugging tools like GDB and IDA Pro. We will also cover how to use the Context Manager to effectively register and handle faults.

We can't guarantee that you will never encounter any errors in your programs after reading this chapter, but we can assure you that you will be equipped with the tools necessary to identify and fix them.

So, turn on your thinking caps and get ready to channel your inner Robin Hood as we steal knowledge from this chapter and apply it to our programs. Let's get started!
# The Adventures of Robin Hood and the Debugging Techniques

Once upon a time, in the lush green forest outside of Nottingham,Robin Hood and his loyal band of Merry Men were on their way back to their hideout after a long day of thwarting the Sheriff of Nottingham's evil schemes. Suddenly, they heard a voice crying out for help.

They followed the voice to a clearing where they found a lone figure hunched over a small fire. As they approached, they realized that it was ​Linus Torvalds himself facing a programming mystery.

Linus had been working on a piece of software all day, but it simply refused to work no matter what he tried. He was feeling discouraged and needed some help.

Robin Hood and his band of Merry Men were up for any challenge that came their way, so they approached Linus with smiles on their faces. "What's the problem?" Robin Hood asked.

Linus explained the situation and the problems he encountered while developing that piece of code. He had already used print statement and stepping through code techniques but couldn't find the root cause of the exception. Robin was delighted to help a fellow programmer and said, "Don't worry, We'll help you out, but first let's have some dinner."

While Linus was eating dinner with Robin and the Merry Men, Robin started discussing the debugging techniques and tools that he and his team had mastered over years of experience. He explained how to set up breakpoints and demonstrate that using break, step, and continue commands on the GDB console could help in finding the root cause of any problem.

Linus listened carefully, scribbled notes as he ate and asked deeper questions about debugging. Robin knew that with Linus' experience, there was no chance that he would have gotten away with providing sub-standard guidance.

After dinner, they returned to Linus' programming mystery, where Robin shared another technique to help him out, Assembler language debugging with tools like IDA Pro. Robin showed how to debug a code by placing breakpoints and dynamically altering instructions as needed. Linus was thrilled with the debugging techniques; he started working on the code again using Robin's tips and tricks, and within a few hours, it was up and running.

Robin was happy that he could help out a fellow programmer in need, while Linus was grateful for the knowledge shared. They thanked each other for the good company and parted company, with Linus, jumping and skipping back to his office.

From this experience, Robin Hood and his Merry Men learned the importance of debugging tools and techniques for every programmer. They never missed an opportunity to share their knowledge with anyone in need.

And you, dear reader, can also take up the mantle of Robin Hood and use the debugging techniques and tools mastered in this chapter to uncover the mysteries of your code problems. Remember, as a programmer, never hesitate to seek help or offer assistance to your fellow programmers - It could lead to great things!
After a long day of thwarting the Sheriff of Nottingham's evil schemes, Robin Hood and his Merry Men stumbled upon Linus Torvalds facing a programming mystery. In order to help Linus, Robin showed him some of the debugging techniques and tools that they had mastered over years of experience working with ARM assembly.

One of the techniques that Robin shared is the use of breakpoints in GDB. Breakpoints are a way to pause a program at a specific point and examine its current state. To set a breakpoint in GDB, you simply type `break` followed by the line number or function name you want to pause the program at. Once the breakpoint is set, you can use the `run` command to start the program and it will automatically pause at the breakpoint.

Another technique that Robin shared is the use of stepping through code with GDB. This allows you to execute your program one line at a time and examine its state after each step to find out where things are going wrong. To step through code in GDB, you can use the `step` command. This will execute the current line of code and pause again, allowing you to examine the state of the program.

Robin also introduced Linus to the IDA Pro tool for debugging assembler code. IDA Pro is a multi-processor disassembler and debugger that can be used to analyze binary code. It can be used to debug code by placing breakpoints and dynamically altering instructions as needed. This allows you to debug code at the assembly level and gives you a greater level of control over the debugging process.

By using these techniques and tools, Linus was able to identify and fix the problem in his code quickly and efficiently. Furthermore, Robin and the Merry Men learned the importance of debugging tools and techniques for every programmer to master, as they can make the difference between solving a programming problem in a matter of minutes or being stuck for hours.
